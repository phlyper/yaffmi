## Basic usage
1. Open **Yaffmi** by double-clicking the file with the cactus icon. If you downloaded Yaffmi in a ZIP file, you must extract the entire contents of the ZIP first. Do not try to run Yaffmi directly from a ZIP file.
2. Click the **Add** button at the top of the window. Select one or more files to convert, then click **Open**. You may also add files by dragging them onto the file list box in the center of the Yaffmi window.
3. In the drop-down box labeled **Preset**, select the type of file you would like to get as a result of the conversion. Each file you added in step 2 will be converted to the type of file chosen here. If you do not know what to choose, try **MP4 Original Size**. This type of file should play on most modern computers and devices.
4. By default, converted files will be saved to your desktop. If you would like to save these files somewhere else, click the **Output** tab, then click the **Browse...** button under **Output folder**. Select the folder into which you would like to save the converted files, then click **OK**.
5. Click the **Convert** button at the top of the window. Yaffmi will begin converting your files.
6. When the conversion is complete, click the **Done** button. If you would like to cancel the conversion before it is complete, click the **Cancel** button.
7. Your files have now been converted. If you would like to convert other files, click the **Clear List** button at the top of the window, then repeat these instructions from step 2. Otherwise, you may close Yaffmi.
